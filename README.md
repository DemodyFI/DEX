# Market perspective 
Despite the offer and popularity of multiple exchanges on the market, there is plenty of space for growth. Crypto consumers prefer central exchanges for their convenience and ease of use, among other factors, while at the same time they are still mindful of the risk to their wallets. Decentralization of exchanges still has a long way to go when it comes to ease of accessibility for beginners and intermediate consumers. The current range of offers in decentralized exchanges shows complexity is still very much an issue. Some of them though, just don't have proper decentralization and has also been hacked in the process. An exchange cannot be labeled as decentralized, if it can lose or freeze customer funds. Also, a full regulated exchange cannot operate as a decentralized exchange. 

In order to cope with this business context, our vision is to develop a trustless, Permissionless DEX for the Defi ecosystem on Polkadot using Substrate. The project envisages the development of a truly decentralized exchange network in a trustless environment that enables high-frequency trading, high-liquidity and lightning-fast transaction speed to support Defi tokens.

Regarding the first problem, we needed to create features that encourage users to an exchange that includes a fast, responsive UI and trading features. It is primarily to draw day traders and institutional investors who favour centralized platforms cos of speed and efficiency of execution. The Demodyfi system designed to on-ramp both entry-level and advanced users. Throughout this context, we are able to respond to the actual preferences of the target audience by providing the same ease of use. 

# Goals
The primary goal is to incentivize specific user behavior over a pre-defined period. Think of this as Uber rebating a portion of their customers’ rides in Uber stock. Additional to our goal is to create a deflationary asset which is the bridge to the Defi space. DemodyFI wants to provide financial access and services while still having control of your assets. With those goals in mind, we want to enable lower transaction fees, faster confirmations, more efficiency, and providing key features as swapping on a scalable level.

# Mission
Our mission is to accelerate the mass adoption of digital assets by bridging traditional and decentralized finance. Our project is a next-generation Blockchain DEX called DemodyFI. The solution is to build a infrastructure that enable you to take control of your assets combing with easy use of access in UI/UX. 

# Vision
DEFI represents a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organizations, offering complete transparency, total token holder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance.
- Cross-chain swaps (Swap between blockchains) 
- Borderless (Access our platform from anywhere in the world)
- Simple (Easy UI and user experience  is our mission)
- Secure (Stake assets in a non-custodial manner)
- Innovation (Change the rules by joining the governance system)
- Inclusive and permissionless listing (Anyone can operate on the platform)

# How (Problem-solving protocol)
 The success in DeFi comes with several certain challenges, especially with the Ethereum network fees skyrocketing and slow performances, which leaves end-users frustrated as witnessed during the Defi hype. Ethereum is congested and cost efficiency & scalability challenges are driving projects to build on other chains. Leading to emerge to other ecosystems in which these problems will solve. Polkadot can figure as a solution to this problem for our Dex. By choosing Substrate as a fundamental framework that uses the GRANPA consensus algorithm to finalize blocks faster than the current situation. As a result this also provides for cheaper gas fees.
